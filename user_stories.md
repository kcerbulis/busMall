Marketing research team:
--- As a market researcher I would like to see the number of clicks each picture got at the end of the 25 choices so that I get a good idea of which product is the most popular one
--- As a market researcher I would like to see the percentage of times a picture was clicked compared to when it was shown to give an accurate statistic of which product was the most popular
--- As a market researcher I would like the images not to duplicate at each 3 picture instance in order not to taint or research statistics data
---As a market researcher I would need the images not to repeat if they were shown in the previous 3 image instance in order to get fresh reactions from the focus group each times

Focus group:
--- As a member of the focus group I want to take a survey that is visually pleasing in order for me to have a relaxed mind to fully focus on the images
--- As a member of the focus group I want to take a survey that has the images looking dimensionally similar to each other in order to be able to make an accurate comparison between them
--- As a member of the focus group I want to take a survey that has an intuitive use and experience in order for me to choose products with ease
--- As a member of the focus group I want the survey to tell me which was my most favorite product so I can satisfy my curiosity of this surveys outcome
